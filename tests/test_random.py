        Characeteristics of these tests:

            (PanSTARRS?) sources for the entire combined field-of-view using the GSSS
            server.
              * These tests assume combined input exposures for each test have enough
                astrometric sources from the external catalog to perform a high quality
                fit.
          * This test only determines the fit between sources
            extracted from the images by Tweakreg and the source positions included in
            the astrometric catalog.
          * The WCS information for the input exposures do not get updated in this test.
          * No mosaic gets generated.

        Success Criteria:
          * Success criteria hard-coded for this test represents 10mas RMS for the
            WFC3 images based on the fit of source positions to the astrometric catalog
            source positions.
              * RMS values are extracted from optional shiftfile output from `tweakreg`
              * Number of stars used for the fit and other information is not available
                with the current version of `tweakreg`.
